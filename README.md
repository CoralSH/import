# `import.sh`: Modules in Shell!

`import` is part of [`coral`](http://coral.sh).

## TODO
- [X] only load functions when (*if*) called
- [X] don't load the same modules twice
- [ ] allow same modules with same name to be loaded provided their locations are different
- [ ] import variables from the module's `main`
- [ ] `package` calls `package.main` function
- [ ] support for modules in `shell_modules`
